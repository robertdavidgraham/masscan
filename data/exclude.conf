#Subject: Scanning and Probing our network

#Stop scanning and probing our network, 153.11.0.0/16.  We are a defense 
#contractor and report to Federal law enforcement authorities when scans 
#and probes are directed at our network.  I assume you don't want to be 
#part of that report.   Please permanently  remove our network range from 
#your current and future research.

#Thank you

#Subject: Re: please stop the attack to our router
#From: Di Li <di@egihosting.com>
#
#Make sure you stop the scan immediately, that's not OK for any company or
#organization scan our network at all.
#
#If you fail to do that we will block whole traffic from ASN 10439, and we
#will fail a police report after that.
#
#Let me know when you stop, since we still receive the attack from you, and
#by the way your scan are not going anywhere, it's was dropped from our edge
#since the first 5 scan
